### N_body_star_system the ultimate simulator pack by aya (2024-9-8 version 1.0)

## Usage (2024-9-8 version 1.0)
1) Set `simulation_mode` in `main.py` to visualize the known solutions.
2) Set `simulation_mode = 0` in `main.py` for manual simulations.
2) Tweak the `dt` in `main.py` if the simulation is too fast or too slow.
3) Set `max_simulation_count` and `endless_simulation` to set a limit to the simulation, or set `endless_simulation = True` for endless simulation (ctrl+c to stop). 
4) Do `python main.py` to launch vpython visualization.

## ToDo:
1. Program more initial position/velocity generator in `n_body_class.py`, and use that to find more solutions.
2. Put more known solutions in the `solution_sets.py`
